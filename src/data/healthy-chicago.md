In 2016, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) launched Healthy Chicago 2.0, a plan focused on ensuring a city with strong communities and collaborative stakeholders, where all residents enjoy equitable access to resources, opportunities and environments that maximize their health and well-being. Healthy Chicago 2.0 is guided by four key principles:

- **Healthy Chicago 2.0 prioritizes Health Equity**, ensuring that limited resources are allocated to the areas where they are needed most.
- **Healthy Chicago 2.0 is a Collaborative Effort**, providing action steps for health care providers, government agencies, social service providers, advocates, academic institutions, businesses, faith-based organizations and residents to work together to promote health.
- **Healthy Chicago 2.0 addresses the Social Determinants of Health**, understanding that health is impacted by a number of factors, including economic opportunity, education and public infrastructure.
- **Healthy Chicago 2.0 leverages Data and Surveillance** by making sure each goal and action step are measurable.

This table shows the cityâ€™s progress on Healthy Chicago 2.0 indicators. Check back regularly for updates as new data become available, and email HealthyChicago2.0@cityofchicago.org if you would like to join our movement to make Chicago a more connected, vibrant and healthy city for all residents.
