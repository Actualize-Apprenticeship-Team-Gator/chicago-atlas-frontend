Writing unit tests was not convered in scope of phase 1 of this project, but infractructure for this is implemented. It is recommended to test React reducers and action creators to ensure state immuntability. Components can also be tested for regression and behavior.

For more information about running tests see [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests).

Example of unit tests for reducers can be found [here](../src/jsx/__tests__).
